## To continue after the workshop
### Using Python on your local machine
##### Text editors
I am partial to [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) but there are lots of great editors out there

##### Shells
Macs come with a built-in shell called the Terminal app

There are [a bunch of options](https://www.slant.co/topics/1552/~terminal-emulators-for-windows) for Windows users

##### Mac Users
Macs come with Python already installed!
  * Just open Terminal and `cd` into the directory where your Python file is saved
  * `python my_file.py` to run it

##### Windows Users
Download Python 2.7 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/)
